# better conversationality
* need to be a better listener
* be present - (don't multitask when conversing). Focus in
* Conversational narcissim - ignoring the other person
* Mindfulness training - let thoughts that pop into your head go back out. Meditation helps with that
* Improv - "yes, and"
* Co-talk - repeat back words that people say
* Enter conversations with the intention of learning from other people
* Watch your partner's patterns for the best time for their mood - eg after eating, before starting important conversations
* Keep conversations brief, keep trace of time
* Try not to go on tangents
* Keep the phone out of sight

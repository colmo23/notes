better conversationality
need to be a better listener
be present - (don't multitask when conversing). Focus in
Conversational narcissim - ignoring the other person
Mindfulness training - let thoughts that pop into your head go back out. Meditation helps with that
Improv - "yes, and"
Co-talk - repeat back words that people say
Enter conversations with the intention of learning from other people
Watch your partner's patterns for the best time for their mood - eg after eating, before starting important conversations
Keep conversations brief, keep trace of time
Try not to go on tangents
Keep the phone out of sight

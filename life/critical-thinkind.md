# Critical thinking killers
- Overrelience on authority - challenge assumption
- Black and white - false dichotomy
- Moral judgements 
- Labels - don't overruse labels
- Resistance to change

# Types of thinking
- Critical thinking is judging decisions and ideas. Looking for evidence, checking
- Creative thinking is looking for new ideas
- Strategic is using insights to overcome barriers and achieve goals

# Questions
- Why are we doing this?
- What are the right questions to ask?
- What can we safely assume?
- Are we using insights from the wisets point of view?
- How strongly is our reasoning supported by relevant information?
- Are we all agreeing on the meaning of this idea or concept?
- What's the best way to interpret this information?

# Ability to change your mind.
Argue from different sides of the debate

# Modes of thinking
- System 1 thinking: fast, subconconsious, intuitive. Subject to biases.
- System 2 thinking: slow, effortful, controlled

To help with system 2 thinking you need no distractions, lots of sleep

# Bias
- Blind spot biases - easier to spot bias in others that yourself
- Confirmation bias - seek evidence that confirms beliefs, reject evidence that does not
- Affect Heuristic - using emotions to make decisions
- Clustering illusion - seeing patterns in random events
- Availability heuristic - overestimate likelyhood of events that come easily to mind
- False concensus bias

# Intuition
Trusting Intuition - REF
- R - regularity
- E - exposure
- F - feedback
If you have these 3 condition you can trust your intuition

# Conterfactual thinking
thinking of alternative outcomes to past events
 - think of a event from the past. Modify a factor to the event, assess what would have happened

Loss aversion - we avoid losses more than we go for gains

# Fallacies
- Logical fallacy - flaws in reasoning
- Post hoc, ergo propter hox - after this, therefore because of this. Correlation with causation
- Ad Hominem - ignore the agrument, attack the person
- Straw man - substitue an argument with mispresented view of it
- Hasty generalisations


#Planning fallacy
 - being overly optimistic
 - failing to consider data
Inside view: gathering info, determining length, adding up
Outside view: finding references, using data, adjusting projection  <-- this is better
Look for historical examples of projects and use them as estimates for planning

# Questions
How questions are framed matters
Positive framing, negative framing

Intellectual curiosity - asking questions

## Bucket questions
 - knowledge question
 - opinion question
 - judgement question
## Interrogation questions 
 - well stated
 - biased

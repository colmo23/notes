meditation provides mindfulness
come to know the mind intimately.
the mind is like a sixth sense
proprioception - self perception
interception - knowing how you body is in general
awareness - just seeing, just hearing. Often we are on autopilot and don't notice things
no matter what's wrong with you, there's more right that wrong
mindfulness  - a way of being and living
in Asian language the word for mind and heart are the same
we are mindless most of the time
the challenge is to be yourself
for the first 10 years don't tell anyone you are meditating
you are already in the greatest place you'll ever be and it's this moment
we having nothing but moments to live
poisonous mind states: greed, hatred, delusion
mindfulness is a way of being
meditation is a technique to wake up to the actuality of what's already here
attitudinal factors: non-judging, patience, beginner's mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance
In the mind of the beginner there are infinite possibilities. We need to maintain that mindset. Expertise can get in the way of knowing what we don't know. I know nothing
non-striving - having nowhere to go. the agenda is to be awake
we only have moments. this moment is as good as any other. 
sometimes you have to go through denial, anger to get to acceptance
mindfulness is the challenge of a lifetime to grow into who you actually are
there is no clinging to I, me or my.
Aristotle: the unexamined life is not worth living
it's the awareness that's important. awareness of breathing, or hearing or of thoughts
